                                           ***JAVA DATABASE CONNECTIVITY***


   ---> JDBC Connection Process <---
            
   *There are Seven Steps to Connect your Java code to Database:
                                      
                               -->Here,Jdbc plays a role.


                               --> Import Packages (Sql,DriverManager,etc..)


                               -->Load and Register the Driver(Using forName()) 

                                  
                                  *Use of forName() method is Loader Invocation implcitly to Load a Several RDBMS Drivers 
                                    Like mySql,Postgresql,etc..
                                    
                  
                                  **(Get Latest version Drivers from Official Websites)**




                               -->Connection Via user to DataBase By DriverManager (using getConnection(url,name,pwd))


               
                               -->Statement are: CreateStatement,PreparedStatement, Callable Statement
                                  Using connection obj as reference to invoke statement method.



                               -->ResultSet is the Object Structure to Hold the Requested Output from the Database as Table Structure.
                                  -> It use statement obj as reference to invoke exceuteQuery(),UpdateQuery(),etc..



                               --> For Retrival: use of next(),getInt(i),getString(i) (were i is column-index)

                                
                                    -> For Initial Retrival from ResultSet data, Assume The Current pointer points on above the first row as null
                                    
                                    ->For Every Intial Retrival,the pointer should be moved to first row using next() method.
                                       
                                    -> Then, The Normal Retrivals Begins.



                               --> Finally, Close the Object of Connection,Statement and So on.
